# Moral Contagion on Reddit â€“ SMDA Project


This repository contains all materials necessary to reproduce the full research workflow

## Final Paper  
The PDF version of my final report (also submitted via email) can be found under `Final Paper`.

## Jupyter Notebook  
The notebook `Project_SMDA.ipynb` includes all steps of the analysis:
- Data retrieval & cleaning  
- Preprocessing & feature construction  
- Negative binomial regression models  
- Robustness checks  
- Visualizations & interpretation

The notebook is fully annotated and should be easy to follow.
